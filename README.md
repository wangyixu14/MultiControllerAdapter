# MultiControllerAdapter
This repo is targeting the research of towards safe, robust, and verifiable neural network controller synthesis
based on multiple available neural network controller candidates.  
## Examples
1. Van der Pol's Oscillator
2. 3-dimensional polynomial system 
3. Cartpole system

## ICCAD 2020
The key code of ICCAD 2020 is contained in this repo. Please check the ./os_ppo/ subfolder. 
The MATLAB code is used to compute the inner-approximation of robust invariant set for the synthsized robust neural network controller. The switching strategy learning process by Double DQN is also shown in the adaptation.py.
